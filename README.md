# Password-Generator

## Description

Given the objective I added on to the code given to me allowing for users to create a randomly generated password using prompts and confirms that pop up on the screen and using that information it creates a randomly generated password

## Getting Started
I used google in order to find out which windows prompts I wanted to use and opted for confirms and using that made for loops for when those confirms were true and then used a random number generator I found on the web, then added them all together and had it display.
